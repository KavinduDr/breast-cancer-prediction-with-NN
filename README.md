A simple application done simply because of interest of neural networks.

## What has been done
data.csv cantains around 30 columns whih may cause to breast cancers. So, I have used that data in order to train a model using Neural Network
This neural network consists of 4 layers. Two for input and output while other two as hidden layers in between input and output layer.

## What has been used
Model is trained using tensorflow and keras which is popular libraries.
For the creation of Graphical User Interface I have used custom-tkinter and pillow libraries which can be used to build pleasing GUIs.

### Tools and Libraries Used

The following libraries were utilized to train the model and create a graphical user interface:

- **Model Training**:  
  [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - An open-source library for machine learning and deep learning.  
  [Keras](https://keras.io/) - A high-level neural networks API for TensorFlow.  

- **Data Manipulation**:  
  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Data analysis and manipulation library.  
  [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - A library for numerical computations with arrays.  
  [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - A library for machine learning and data preprocessing.  

- **Graphical Interface**:  
  [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) - A modern graphical user interface for Tkinter.  
  [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - A Python Imaging Library for image processing.  

- **Visualization**:  
  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.  

- **Model Deployment**:  
  [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - A library for model serialization and parallel computing.
